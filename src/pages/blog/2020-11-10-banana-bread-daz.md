  A delicious home-made banana bread with soy milk, will this cereal? 


  The flavour is a no brainer. Chocolate, banana and milk always go together, no matter the consistency/texture/vessel.


  The banana bread soaked up the milk incredibly quickly so eat bit was quite wet. This gave an incredibly smooth mouth texture that allowed for dangerously fast food consumption. I could probably eata whole banana bread loaf in three bites with this method. Very smashable.
