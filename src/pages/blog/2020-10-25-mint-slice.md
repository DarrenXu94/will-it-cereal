description: "Arnott's mint slice biscuits cut into 8ths in Canberra milk. Taste
  is carried by the mint, whereas chocolate and biscuit take a back seat.
  Biscuit goes soggy rapidly, quickly becoming a mush. Honestly was expecting
  more from this delicious snack, taste does not transfer well to milk as a
  whole. "
