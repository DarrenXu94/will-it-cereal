I was pretty optimistic coming into this cereal attempt. My logic was as follows:

1. Baked beans are in tomato soup
2. You can add milk to tomato soup
3. Therefore you can add milk to baked beans.

I was vindicated by this combination. Although, I was hungry at time of consumption, so beware.

To improve it next time, I would add less milk. The ratio was a bit off - I added milk like it was wheatbix but baked beans are clearly less absorbent.
