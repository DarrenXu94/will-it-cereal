description: Every kid dreams of being able to add blocks of chocolate to their
  cereal. But does it actually work? TBH I was 100% convinced that adding Darrel
  Lea's new Fairy Block to soy milk was gonna taste terrible. But look, I must
  say I was pleasantly surprised. It's like eating the block itself, but with
  soy milk to wet the mouth. Moist. Nothing revolutionary. Nothing
  groundbreaking. Simply edible. Should try melting the choc first then mixing
  it with the cereal. Mmmm chocolate milk
